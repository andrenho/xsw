= Introduction =

Colors can be referred to in two ways: by their code or by their name.

== By code ==

Colors can be refered by code, such as this: `$FF00FF` (this is pink). It's just like the [http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html#h-6.5 HTML color standard], except that it uses the character `$` instead of `#`.

== By name ==

Colors can by used by name, using the colors defined in the file `/usr/share/X11/rgb.txt`. Examples: `green, black, snow, LemonChiffon, LavenderBlush, DeepPink2, grey68`, etc...

Here are two color lists, for reference:

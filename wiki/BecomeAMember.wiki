The process to become a member depends on what your concept of member is. Read on.


= Details =

|| *Concept of membership* || Someone who takes part in the project. || Someone who has commit permission. ||
|| *How to join* || Just participate! Opening issues, writing patches and posting to the developer mailing list is open to anyone. All issues, posts are responded quickly, and all patches are tested and incorporated to the project source code in a couple days. || Commit access is restricted to the project manager (myself) for now. This is because I don't have the time nor the skill nor the will to manage programmers. I started this project because I love to code. Keeping the commit access restricted to one person helps the project to maintain focus on what's important and ease the management of the project.(_of course, this might change as the project grows_). ||

xsw is a slideshow presentation tool for all those who are frustrated with
Microsoft PowerPoint and its clones.


Basics
------

By using xsw, you create your presentation "by hand", using the xsw language
described in the manual. A exemple of a file is:

    slide:
      - "Hello" x:50 y:30 align:center
      + "World!"

The first line says we're writing a slide. The second one says: "add the text
'Hello' centered at the position 50x30 (each slide is 100x75)". The third line
says: "write 'hello' using the same parameters that the line before'. That's
what the plus (+) is for.

Let's say you save the script in a file called test.xsw. So, to run, just type:

    $ xsw test.xsw

While xsw has a learning curve, after you learned, you'll be able to build
presentations that look much better than Microsoft PowerPoint.


Images
------

Adding images can be done the following way:

    slide:
      - background: "bg.jpg"
      - image: "image.png" x:10 y:10

This will add two images: one scaled on the background, and a second one in
regular size.


Templates
---------

If you want all your slides to look the same, you can use a template (this
would be called a "master slide" in other programs). Do so the following way:

    template: mytemplate
      - background: "mycompanylogo.jpg"
      - title: x:50 y:10 align:center

    slide: mytemplate
      - title: "My Company"


Other formats
-------------

A xsw presentation can be converted to a PDF file using the xsw2pdf program.


Developing
----------

When developing, use the -l parameter on xsw to go directly to the last slide.
The -d parameter shows a grid to help with the positioning. The same grid can
be show by pressing CTRL+D.

To know more about the commands and parameters you can use, read in the
REFERENCE.
